## Project Components

### 1. User Research
- **Interviews**: Conducted interviews with potential users to understand their pain points and preferences when planning group trips. Key insights included the need for clear communication, budget transparency, and collaborative decision-making.


### 2. Affinity Diagrams
- **Affinity Diagramming**: Organized ideas from brainstorming sessions into themes to identify common patterns and prioritize features. Key themes included:
  - Communication
  - Budget Management
  - Activity Planning
  - User Roles

### 3. Empathy Map
- **Empathy Mapping**: Created an empathy map to visualize user experiences, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to group holiday planning. This helped us understand user needs better and design solutions that address their concerns.

### 4. Ideation
- **Brainstorming Sessions**: We held brainstorming sessions to generate ideas for features that would improve group holiday planning. Ideas included:
  - Collaborative Planning App
  - Budgeting Workshops
  - Group Decision-Making Tools

### 5. User Flows
We developed user flows for two main ideas:

#### A Planning App
- **User Goal**: Make group decisions easily for our holiday.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Login/Signup to the application
  2. Create a new travel destination.
  3. Add your  friends.
  4. Friends vote on their preferred budget,activities and roles.
  5. View results in real-time and finalize decisions.
  6. Create and share the itinerary based on selected options.

#### B. Budgeting Workshops
- **User Goal**: Learn to budget effectively for group travel.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Discover available budgeting workshops.
  2. Register for a workshop.
  3. Attend the workshop and learn budgeting techniques.
  4. Engage in interactive activities to practice skills.
  5. Access resources and tools for budgeting.
  6. Practice budgeting skills with friends.

### 6. Paper Prototypes
We created low-fidelity paper prototypes representing key screens of the app:
- Sign up page /Login page
- Home page
- Trip page
- Budget Page
- Profile page

### 7. Mid-Fidelity Wireframes
Using Figma, we developed mid-fidelity wireframes based on the user flows:
- Black and white designs focusing on layout and functionality without detailed aesthetics.

### 8. Usability Testing
We prepared a usability testing guide to evaluate the prototypes with three participants, focusing on ease of use and clarity of instructions.

### 9. App Name Suggestions
Here are some creative names tailored for a Gen Z audience:
- **TripSync**
- **VibeCheck**
- **SquadGoals**
- **FOMOPlan**
- **WanderFam**
- **ChillTrip**
- **NomadNudge**
- **BopAround**
- **FlexiPlan**
